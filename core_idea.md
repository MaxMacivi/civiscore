# CIVISCORE Original Idea Declaration

This project was first conceptualized and initiated by the author in May 2025.

CIVISCORE is not just a tool — it is a **socio-technical framework** for building post-platform, post-algorithmic truth navigation systems.

The entire structure — including scoring chain, storage chain, and gamified participatory layer — is designed with **open, non-coercive collaboration** as its core principle.

## ✅ Permitted Use Cases

- Civic tech initiatives
- Education and media literacy
- Open science and public information platforms
- Community governance experiments

## 🚫 Forbidden Use Cases

- AI-driven censorship engines
- Platform-level truth ranking mechanisms
- Government propaganda scoring systems
- Closed recommender algorithm overlays

The author retains moral authorship and requests that any derivative works preserve this purpose clause in spirit and implementation.
